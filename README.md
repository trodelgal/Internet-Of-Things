# Internet of Things (IoT) Course - Introduction

## Course Overview

In recent years, the field of **Internet of Things (IoT)** has rapidly grown and is becoming a dominant force in modern computing. The expectation is that soon, most network traffic will not come from computers but from **connected objects** and devices, fundamentally reshaping the structure of the internet.

While the full potential of this revolution is still ahead of us, it is already influencing key areas of life such as:

- **Economy**
- **Society**
- **Industry**
- **Commerce**
- **Personal Lifestyle**

In this course, we explored the **technological principles** behind connecting a new generation of devices to the internet and practiced developing them step by step:

1. **Building and programming objects** using microcontrollers, particularly from the Arduino and ESP32 families.
2. **Working with lightweight and dynamic network protocols** designed for IoT applications.
3. **Leveraging server-side infrastructures**, network services, and runtime environments to support these new computing platforms.
