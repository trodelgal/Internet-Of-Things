# Self Stress Reduction IoT Kit

## Description

The **Self Stress Reduction IoT Kit** is a portable and comprehensive system designed to help users manage stress and promote relaxation through a combination of physical sensors, web services, and smartphone interactions. Using technologies such as **Blynk** and **make.com**, the kit integrates guided breathing exercises, emergency alerts, aromatherapy, and relaxing music to enhance well-being.

This project highlights how IoT can transform everyday environments into calm, stress-free spaces with practical tools and seamless automation.

## System Functionality

1. **Automatic Relaxing Music Playback**:

   - A **light sensor** detects when the kit box is opened.
   - The system triggers relaxing music to play on the userâ€™s smartphone for an immersive calming experience.

2. **Emergency Alert System**:

   - A **joystick button** serves as an emergency button.
   - When pressed, it sends an **SMS notification** to a designated contact via **make.com** for immediate assistance.

3. **Guided Breathing Training**:

   - An **Adafruit NeoPixel LED strip** visually guides users through timed breathing exercises (inhalation and exhalation).
   - The **Blynk app** tracks the number of completed breath cycles.

4. **Aromatherapy with Essential Oil Diffuser**:

   - A **servo motor** operates an essential oil diffuser to dispense drops of lavender oil for relaxation.
   - Activation is controlled via the **Blynk app**.

5. **Monitoring Environmental Conditions**:
   - A **DHT22 sensor** measures **temperature and humidity**, ensuring a comfortable environment.

## Code Snippet

Here is an example of activating the aromatherapy diffuser using a servo motor:

```cpp
void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  // Update strip for breath train
  if (breath_train == 1) {
    led_strip_update();
  }

  // Servo up
  if (diffude == 1 && pos < 90) {
    pos += 2;
    myservo.write(pos);
  }

  // End of defuse
  if (diffude == 1 && currentMillis - last_defuse > defuseDuration) {
    diffude = 0;
  }

  // Servo down
  if (diffude == 0 && pos > 0) {
    pos -= 2;
    myservo.write(pos);
  }

  Blynk.run();
  timer.run();

  // Light sensor reader for box open or close
  int sensorValue = analogRead(LIGHT_SENSOR_PIN);
  if (sensorValue < lightSensorThreshold && !box_is_open && currentMillis - last_music_switch > musicSwitchDelay) {
    last_music_switch = currentMillis;
    box_is_open = true;
    Serial.println("Play music");
    Serial.print("light: ");
    Serial.println(sensorValue);
    play_music();
  }
  if (sensorValue > lightSensorThreshold && box_is_open && currentMillis - last_music_switch > musicSwitchDelay) {
    last_music_switch = currentMillis;
    box_is_open = false;
    Serial.println("Stop music");
    Serial.print("light: ");
    Serial.println(sensorValue);
    stop_music();
  }

  // Handle a click on emergency button
  int emergency_button = digitalRead(JOYSTICK_SW_PIN);
  if (emergency_button == 0 && currentMillis - last_sms > smsCooldown) {
    last_sms = currentMillis;
    Serial.println("emergency clicked");
    send_sms();
  }
}
```
